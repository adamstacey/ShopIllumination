	                        	<h5>Do I have to pay delivery per item?</h5>
	                        	<p><strong>The majority of items we sell can now be delivered at no cost (subject to items ordered and selected delivery address).</strong><br />If there is a delivery cost to pay you only pay per delivery and <strong>NOT</strong> per item.</p>
	                        	<h5>Do you deliver anywhere?</h5>
								<p>We deliver most items anywhere within the UK including Scottish Highlands, North and Republic of Ireland and Channel islands. (Some areas exclude Worktops and American Fridges.)</p>
								<h5>Can you deliver to a different address?</h5>
								<p>Yes we can but you will need to put your order through online for fraud security reasons.</p>
								<h5>How do you deliver large/heavy items?</h5>
								<p>We normally like to do most areas by home delivery using a two man delivery service. This way goods are handled correctly and taken into your property.</p>
								<p>We also deliver by pallet service which is often much quicker, however this is a door step delivery only. (They will <strong>NOT</strong> take goods into the property.)</p>
								<p><strong>Special Note</strong><br />Some parts of Scotland, Ireland and Channel islands are pallet service only.</p>						
								<h5>Delivery Access</h5>
								<p>Let us know if delivery access is restricted.</p>
								<p>Restricted access includes:</p>
