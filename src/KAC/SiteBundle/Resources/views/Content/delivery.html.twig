                                    <p>Our pallet deliveries are subcontracted out to palletised carrier companies who use tail-lifts to lower pallets to ground level, before manoeuvring them into place with pallet trucks. In order to achieve this, you must ensure there is a hard flat surface outside your property free from grass, gravel or uneven paving. It is your responsibility to advise us of any delivery restrictions prior to goods being despatched.</p>
                                    <p>The following checklist is provided to ensure that delivery is achieved in the easiest and safest manner for all concerned:</p>
                                    <ul class="tick-list mtn pbm">
                                        <li>Is access to your property suitable; not just your drive but also any roads approaching your property (weight limit restrictions, narrow lanes, etc)? Can a refuse lorry or fire engine gain access to your property easily?</li>
                                        <li>Is the allocated drop off point on a flat level surface free from grass, gravel, uneven paving etc?</li>
                                        <li>If ground or access is unsuitable, pallets may be left on the roadside or kerbside at the drivers discretion.</li>
                                        <li>Will you (or a designated individual) be available to sign for the goods and be contactable on the contact number supplied?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>By placing an order you understand and agree that your order will be off-loaded using a tail-lift (not a crane) and you have a flat level surface free from grass or gravel as set out in our <a class="colour-grey" target="_blank" href="{{ path('content_terms_and_conditions') }}">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>

                                <p>We will email you to let you know when your order has been dispatched. You will then receive a phone call within 1-3 days to arrange a suitable delivery time.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Once the product(s) have been checked to your satisfaction we require you to sign for the delivery. Unless otherwise stated the delivered price includes a one-man ground floor, street level, drop off delivery.</li>
                        <li>Deliveries are booked on the condition that there is reasonable access for the safe and prompt delivery of the products(s). Any special requirements should be reported to us when ordering (for example, if you require a delivery to a flat that is not on the ground floor).</li>
                        <li>We endeavour to meet all delivery bookings but cannot be held responsible for situations beyond our control.</li>
                        <li>It is your responsibility to ensure that you have signed for the correct products(s) and number of products(s) delivered.</li>
                        <li>Any delivery issues will be resolved by our Customer Services team at the point of delivery.</li>
                        <li>We recommend that you organise the fitting date of your products(s) once they have been delivered and inspected to your satisfaction.</li>
                        <li>If your billing address and delivery address differ, we will need to validate the information provided with our Identity Verification partner. In addition, we may require a copy of a utility bill to verify invoice address details. This will help to protect you and us against fraudulent transactions.</li>
                        <li>When purchasing large items such as Worktops, American Fridge Freezers or Range Cookers, please ensure that you have measured the relevant doorways in your home to make sure that the product(s) will fit through when delivered. Unfortunately if the delivery fails due to this reason the actual cost of the distribution will be charged to you.</li>
                        <li>Failed deliveries will incur an additional delivery charge if you are not present on the agreed delivery date and the actual cost of distribution will be charged to you.</li>
                        <li>If delivery is refused due to selecting the wrong delivery method and the order is cancelled or part cancelled you will receive a refund for the cancelled amount minus our incurred delivery costs.</li>
                        <li>Should you wish to cancel your order after we have dispatched your goods, an additional delivery charge would be levied. (Please refer to the <a href="#cancellationAndReturns">Cancellations and Returns</a> section)</li>
                        <li>Cancellation at the point of delivery will incur a collection charge. (Please refer to the <a href="#cancellationAndReturns">Cancellations and Returns</a> section)</li>
