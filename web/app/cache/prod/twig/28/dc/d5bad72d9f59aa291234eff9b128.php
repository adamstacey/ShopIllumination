\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>We will confirm acceptance (or otherwise) of your order as soon as possible, either by email (if your order is placed on-line) or by telephone (if your order is placed over the telephone). A binding agreement arises once we accept your order and we will then charge your credit/debit card on acceptance of your order.</p>
\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5>Payments</h5>
\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>You can pay for your order by Visa Debit, MasterCard, Maestro and Solo. We will take all reasonable care to keep your order details secure.</p>
\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5>Cancellation and Returns Information</h5>
\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Any transit damage, shortages or incorrect goods supplied must be noted on the delivery note at the time of delivery.</p>
\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Please ensure that you thoroughly inspect your goods for any cosmetic damage, incorrect goods, missing parts or other problems as soon as you receive them. If this is done after delivery has taken place, you are required to contact us within 7 days of delivery of your goods giving full details of any problems for us to arrange for suitable action to be taken.</p>
\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5>Damaged Goods</h5>
\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you receive goods in a damaged condition, please make a note of this on the despatch note, you will need to notify us of this by phone, email or letter in any case within 7 days from receipt of goods.</p>
\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Please Note</strong><br />Do not fit an item if it is damaged. This counts as acceptance of goods and the item is then non returnable.</p>
\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5>Incorrect Goods or Wrong Amount of Goods Received</h5>
\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>It is your responsibility to ensure that you have signed for the correct number of goods delivered. At time of delivery you must also check that you have received the correct goods in accordance with your order.</p>

\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5>Unwanted Items</h5>
\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>You have the right to cancel your order at any time before goods are delivered to you for any reason.</p>
\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In compliance with the distance selling regulations you have a \"Cooling Off\" period where you may withdraw from this agreement at any time up to 7 days after the day we have delivered the goods to you. If we have delivered the goods, you must not have used them and must have kept them in the condition they were delivered. You must return them to us, at your cost. Returned items after 7 days may be subject to a 25% handling charge.</p>
\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>When we receive the goods we will inspect them to ensure all manuals, accessories and other components are within the returned package and that the goods are in the condition that we sent them to you with packaging. All items are subject to inspection. If we receive an item that either is not in the condition we sent it or has missing components we shall deduct a reasonable amount to cover any costs to us or return them to you if they are not re-sellable.</p>

If we find that the item is not in its original packaging and has any accessories or components missing we shall carry out the refund and take out a fee to cover any costs.</li>
\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>
\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Please Note</strong><br />Any faulty items have to be seen by an authorised service engineer before any action can be taken. If your goods are not found to be faulty, a call-out charge may be incurred.</p>
\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If your item becomes faulty after having been fitted for more than 28 days, please contact the Manufacturer directly to arrange a service call, this is part of the manufacturer's guarantee.</p>
